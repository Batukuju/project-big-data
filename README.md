### LIBRARY SYSTEM
The aim to this project is to create application that will use cassandra distributed system for library management.

In our library system the client has his own favourite library, that he can borrow a book from or return one. He can return only books to the library that they were borrowed from, and vice versa.

Every client has his own shelf with titles of borrowed books. Every library has its own collection that contains titles and availability of all books in this library. When the book is borrowed, the availability is set to False, and the title appears in client own shelf. Whern the client returns the book, the title is deleted from his private shelf and the availability is changed to True again.

The project is divided into 2 parts:
1) Console application, where as a client you want to return or borrow a book from one library.
2) Stress tests:
Stress Test 1: The client makes the same request very quickly. -> Client want to borrow the same book all and all over again.
Stress Test 2: Two or more clients make the possible requests randomly.-> 2 clients select to borrow/return a book as two separate thread. 
Stress Test 3: Immediate occupancy of all seats/reservations on 2 clients.-> 2 clients are iterativelly borrowing all book from library.
Stress Test 4: (only for pairs) constant cancellations and seat occupancy. -> Client can return the book to the library.

# File system:
-story.py -> Console Application
-main.py -> Main file to get familiar with the system
-client.py -> Client class 
-library.py -> Library class 


-data/library.csv -> Data for initial setup
-data/client.csv -> Data for initial setup
-data/books.csv -> Data for initial setup

-setup.bash -> Runs dockers with cassandra on 3 nodes and create initial values for system (libraries, clients, books)
-start_simple.bash -> Runs docker with cassandra and create initial values for system (libraries, clients, books)
-initial_setup.py -> Creates initial values for system (libraries, clients, books)

# How to run our project?
$ bash setup.bash
To get console aplication:
  $ python3 story.py
To play around:
  $ python3 main.py
